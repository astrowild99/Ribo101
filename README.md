All the Files used for the "Ribo101" Ben Eater-inspired 8-bit ttl logic computer

Ribo101 is a ttl-logic machine inspired by Ben Eater 8-bit computer tutorial: https://eater.net/8bit

The specs are the following:
  ~ 100-200 Hz 555 timer clock speed (not measured precisely)
  3 general purpose 8-bit registers
  LCD Hitaci output
  7 segment display decimal output
  32-instruction set (homemade and very loosely inspired by older architectures)
  + 1 onboard arduino nano to boot up the machine and load the ram with programs
 
One day all the schematics and the system will be uploaded
